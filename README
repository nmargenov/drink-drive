# Drink Drive website

Drink Drive a website I did for my friend's small business.  The site boasts a simple design, featuring a single form for ordering a car online and buttons for directly calling the service.

## Live production
You can see the production [here](https://www.drinkdriveplovdiv.com/).

## Installation
To get started, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## EmailJS
You need a registration in [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/). Follow the steps and create a template. The form works with this service and needs environment variables. This service is used to minimize backend server hosting costs for email needs, tailored to the client's requirements.

## Environment variables
```
VITE_APP_SERVICE_ID = Service ID provided by EmailJS
VITE_APP_TEMPLATE_ID = Template ID provided by EmailJS
VITE_APP_PUBLIC_KEY =  = Public Key provided by EmailJS
 ```
